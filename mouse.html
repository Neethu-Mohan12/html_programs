    <h1>Mouse</h1>
    <p style="margin:auto">A computer mouse (plural mice, also mouses)[nb 1] is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of the pointer (called a cursor) on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface of a computer.

        The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was done by Doug Engelbart in the Mother of All Demos. Mice originally used two separate wheels to directly track movement across a surface: one in the X-dimension and one in the Y. Later, the standard design shifted to use a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion, in turn connected to internal rollers. Most modern mice use optical movement detection with no moving parts. Though originally all mice were connected to a computer by a cable, many modern mice are cordless, relying on short-range radio communication with the connected system.</p>
