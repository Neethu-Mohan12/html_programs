    <h1>Scanner</h1>
    <p style="margin:auto">A scanner is an electrical device that reads and converts documents such as photos and pages of text into a digital signal. This changes the documents in a form that can be viewed and or modified on a computer system by using software applications. There are numerous kinds of scanners available in the market that have different resolutions.

        Most scanners have a flat scanning surface as they are flatbed devices, which are mainly used for scanning magazines, photographs, and numerous documents. Furthermore, because most flatbed scanners have a cover that lifts up, they can scan books and other heavy things. A sheet-fed scanner is another type of scanner that is only able to accept paper documents. Although sheet-fed scanners have no capability of scanning books, some of their models include a feature of an automatic document feeder (ADF) that allows various pages to be scanned in sequence.</p>
